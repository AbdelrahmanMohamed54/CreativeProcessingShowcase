## Introduction

This repository contains Processing sketches and projects completed as part of my programming lectures. The exercises vary in complexity and cover a wide range of topics, from static designs to animated elements and games.

## Exercise Descriptions

### 1. Draw an Image
- **Exercise 1:**
  Create an intriguing Processing sketch that produces a unique design or picture.
  - **Size:** 640x480px
  - **Shapes:** Incorporate at least 3 primitive shapes for variety.
  - **Colors:** Enhance visual appeal by using at least 3 different colors.
  - **Code Complexity:** Ensure the sketch consists of more than 10 but fewer than 50 statements.
  - **Creativity:** Unleash your imagination to craft a visually captivating image.
  - **Storage:** Save the final image.

---

### 2. Beautify my Slides
- **Exercise 2:**
  Develop a Processing sketch that creates a visually appealing design suitable for enhancing presentation slides.
  - **Size:** 960x339px (or 1920x678px).
  - **Background:** Utilize a non-white background to add vibrancy.
  - **Creativity:** Employ any elements of your choice to achieve a creative result.
  - **Copyright:** Ensure that the sketch does not violate copyright, especially regarding recognizable figures like Disney characters.
  - **Commenting:** Clearly comment your sketch, including your intention and name.

---

### 3. An Animation
- **Exercise 3:**
  Craft an animated Processing sketch featuring an engaging element moving across the drawing area.
  - **Size:** 640x480px
  - **Elements:** Include non-animated background elements (more than 5) and an animated object moving from left to right or top down.
  - **Motion Continuity:** Ensure the object reappears from the opposite side when it leaves the drawing area.
  - **Commenting:** Clearly comment your sketch following the provided guidelines.
  - **Frame Storage:** Save two frames of your animation as images.

---

### 4. A Simple Game
- **Exercise 4:**
  Implement a simple game in Processing where a circle bounces within the drawing area, and the user must keep the mouse tip within the circle.
  - **Game Elements:** Include a bouncing circle, track user interaction, and display current and high scores.
  - **Physics:** Apply physically correct bouncing, current speed, and acceleration to the circle.
  - **Randomization:** Modify acceleration randomly over time, ensuring a challenging yet beatable game.
  - **Graphics:** Utilize extremely simple graphics while showcasing the effective use of variables and control structures.

---

### 5. An Explosion
- **Exercise 5:**
  Develop a Processing sketch simulating a simple explosion.
  - **Size:** 640x480px
  - **Initialization:** Start with a blank or simple background drawing.
  - **User Interaction:** On mouse click, generate multiple shapes (circles, for example) at the mouse tip, flying in random directions and gradually getting smaller.
  - **Dynamic Interaction:** While the mouse is pressed, continuously reduce the size of the shapes with each frame.
  - **Capture Moment:** Save a screenshot upon mouse release.
  - **Submission:** Mandatory exercise with specified naming conventions.

---

### 6. Resettable Explosion
- **Exercise 6:**
  Create a Processing sketch for a resettable explosion.
  - **Drawing Area:** Shapes leave the drawing area eventually.
  - **Reset Feature:** On a subsequent mouse click, reset the explosion, making all visible shapes vanish and restarting the process.

---

### 7. Recursive Sketch
- **Exercise 7:**
  Design a Processing sketch utilizing recursion.
  - **Drawing Area:** Sized at 640x480px.
  - **Parameter Changes:** Mouse movement in x and y directions alters recursion parameters (e.g., recursion depth, lengths, angles).
  - **Screenshot Capture:** Save a screenshot on mouse press.
  - **Naming and Formatting:** Adhere to the Java code style guide, properly comment your sketch, and submit with correct naming conventions.

---

### 8. Creative Recursion
- **Exercise 8 (Variant 1):**
  Demonstrate an in-depth understanding of recursion by drawing a creative and unique figure, avoiding commonly known recursive drawings.
  - **Parameters:** Include at least 2 parameters influenced by mouse movement in x and y directions.
  - **Complexity:** Utilize vector computations or other interesting elements, surpassing the simplicity of typical recursive circle examples.
  - **Submission:** This was the task i did and it's available in the repository.

---

### 9. Snowflake Recursion
- **Exercise 8 (Variant 2):**
  Create a Processing sketch that draws a snowflake growing from the center of the frame using recursive triangles or your variant.
  - **Parameters:** Incorporate at least 2 parameters influenced by mouse movement in x and y directions.

---

### 10. Altered Recursive Tree
- **Exercise 8 (Variant 3):**
  Adapt the recursive tree example by implementing specific modifications and additional tasks.
  - **Branching Chance:** Introduce a random chance for more than 2 branches.
  - **Child Branch Origin:** Specify that a child branch doesn't start at the tip of the parent but from the branch itself.
  - **Optional Tasks:** Choose and implement at least 2 additional tasks from the provided list.
  - **Mouse-Influenced Parameters:** Select 2 parameters influenced by mouse position within a meaningful range.
